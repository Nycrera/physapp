# physapp

A freelance web app that I've created for a client. But client, later on, did not require it anymore, so I made it public.
It's nothing fancy. Some simple CRUD operations on a mysqldb, user system, an admin page to manage users and visualize data with graphs.

The idea was that physiotherapy patients would log in to the app, follow video instructions for their daily rehabilitation exercises.
And then a professional, with an admin account, would be able to follow and graph their progress, assign new exercises etc.
